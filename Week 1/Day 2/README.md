# 📅 Week 1 — Day 2: Advanced SQL Queries

> **Focus:** Mastering advanced querying techniques including ORDER BY sorting, all types of JOINs, nested subqueries, and complex combined queries.

---

## 📝 Overview

Day 2 continued SQL practice from Day 1, focusing on advanced querying techniques — specifically ORDER BY, all types of JOINs, nested/correlated subqueries, and combined moderate-difficulty queries. All queries were written and tested on [db-fiddle.com](https://www.db-fiddle.com/) using the same Employee-Department-Project schema.

## 🗄️ Schema Used

Same three-table schema as Day 1 — Employee, Department, and Project. Refer to the [Day 1 README](../Day%201/README.md) for the full schema breakdown.

## 📚 Topics Covered

### 1. ORDER BY Queries
Learned how to sort query results by one or multiple columns in ascending or descending order. Also combined `ORDER BY` with `GROUP BY` to sort aggregated results.
- **Key clauses:** `ORDER BY`, `ASC`, `DESC`
- **Key concept:** Multiple columns can be chained in `ORDER BY` — rows are sorted by the first column, then ties are broken by the second column.

### 2. JOIN Queries
Learned how to combine data from multiple tables using different types of JOINs. Practiced retrieving related records across Employee, Department, and Project tables.
- **Key JOIN types:**
  
  | JOIN Type | What it returns |
  |-----------|----------------|
  | `INNER JOIN` | Only rows with a match in both tables |
  | `LEFT JOIN` | All rows from the left table, NULLs where no match on the right |
  | Self JOIN | Joining a table to itself to compare rows within the same table |

- **Key concept:** `LEFT JOIN` combined with `WHERE column IS NULL` is a powerful pattern to find records that have *no* match in another table (e.g., employees without a department, departments without employees).

### 3. Nested and Correlated Queries
Learned to write subqueries — queries nested inside another query. Also practiced correlated subqueries where the inner query references values from the outer query row by row.
- **Key concepts:**
  - A **scalar subquery** returns a single value used in `WHERE` (e.g., `WHERE salary = (SELECT MAX(...))`)
  - A **correlated subquery** references the outer query's current row — runs once per row
  - `LIMIT 1 OFFSET n` can be used to get the nth highest value
  - `IN (subquery)` filters rows based on a list returned by a subquery

### 4. Combined Moderate Difficulty Queries
Applied multiple SQL concepts together in a single query — combining `WHERE`, `GROUP BY`, `HAVING`, `ORDER BY`, `JOIN`, and subqueries to solve more realistic data questions.
- **Key concept:** Real-world SQL queries often chain multiple clauses. The logical order of execution is: `FROM` → `JOIN` → `WHERE` → `GROUP BY` → `HAVING` → `SELECT` → `ORDER BY` → `LIMIT`.

## 💡 Key Learnings

- `ORDER BY` can sort by multiple columns — useful for tie-breaking within groups
- `INNER JOIN` returns only matched rows; `LEFT JOIN` preserves all rows from the left table with NULLs for unmatched rows
- A **self-join** lets you compare rows within the same table (e.g., finding colleagues in the same department)
- **Correlated subqueries** reference the outer query row — useful for per-row comparisons like "salary above their own department's average"
- `LIMIT 1 OFFSET n-1` retrieves the nth highest value without window functions
- `HAVING` can combine multiple aggregate conditions using `AND` / `OR`
- The SQL clause execution order matters — `WHERE` runs before grouping, `HAVING` runs after
